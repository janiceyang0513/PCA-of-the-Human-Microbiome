# PCA-of-the-Human-Microbiome

Microbiomes, microscopic communities of bacteria in a particular environment, exist all over the human body and are responsible for carrying out numerous essential biological functions. 
In fact, bacteria living on the human body outnumber human cells 10 to 1. Despite their tremendous importance, microbiomes are difficult for researchers to study and understand due to their complexity and minuscule scale. 
Our research examines data from The Human Microbiome Project, which contains 2,913 individual samples, measuring 43,144 variables. Using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce our multi-dimensional data, we compared the clustering of samples from various regions of the body. We hypothesized that microbiomes can be clearly classified by which microbial varieties are present in the sample. 
Our PCA was successful in representing a large proportion of the variation in our data in a few principal components. By projecting the data onto principal component axes and analyzing the clustering of data points, we were able to distinguish microbiome samples taken from different regions of the body based on their unique microbial composition.
